        This is ALWAYS safe.

	
		To maintain the original object, we need a pointer though. If not, then we're just calling the copy constructor of the base class and lose all the info of the derived.

		Unique pointers owns and manages an object through a pointer.
		std::unique_ptr<derived> pDerived = std::make_unique<derived>("Gotham", 5);

		
		You can upcast by using the base type in the unique_ptr.
		std::unique_ptr<base> pBase = std::make_unique<derived>("Gotham", 5);
		  OR
		std::unique_ptr<base> pBase = std::move(pDerived); https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/utility-functions?view=msvc-170&redirectedfrom=MSDN&f1url=%3FappId%3DDev16IDEF1%26l%3DEN-US%26k%3Dk(std%253A%253Amove)%3Bk(move)%3Bk(DevLang-C%252B%252B)%3Bk(TargetOS-Windows)%26rd%3Dtrue#move
